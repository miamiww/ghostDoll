## Welcome to Sophia's Haunted Doll Zone
get running quick with '~/AIY-voice-kit-python/env/bin/python -u ~/ghostDoll/src/ghostVoice.py'

src/ghostVoice.py is the main script
the google AIY python virtual environment is in ~/AIY-voice-kit-python/env/
maybe one day it will be someplace better

the arduino code to listen for knocking is in /ghostKnock
you shouldn't need to modify that or reupload to the arduino, but just in case you do it's there
